# Link List (the clone)
Since I had no portfolio or applications to show my technical skills, I decided to clone [The urlist](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) showing the different aspects of application development with which I am familiar.
### The stack
##### Backend:
- [Dotnet core webapi (c#)](https://github.com/gromney/linklist.api)
- MongoDb
- Auth0 authentication
- Github Actions (CI/CD)
##### Frontend:
- Angular
- Bulma css

### Demo / Screenshot

A live demo of [Link List App](https://link-list.azurewebsites.net/) is available without having to download and configure the repositories
